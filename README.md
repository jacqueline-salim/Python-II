Pandas is a powerful data analysis and manipulation library for Python. It provides easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for handling numerical tables and time series data. With its intuitive syntax and comprehensive functionality, pandas is widely used for data preprocessing, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis in data science and machine learning workflows.

**Key features include:**
- DataFrame object for data manipulation with integrated indexing.
- Tools for reading and writing data between in-memory data structures and various file formats.
- Handling of missing data, reshaping, and pivoting of datasets.
- Data alignment and integrated handling of time series functionality.

Pandas is built on top of NumPy and is an essential tool for any Python-based data professional or researcher.
